# TEI_2015

Welcome! On this repository you will find the information you need to start fabricating your own grounded spatial haptic device based on our default open source design. This site is essentially the companion to our TEI2015 conference paper WoodenHaptics: A Starting Kit for Crafting Force-Reflecting Spatial Haptic Devices. We hope you want to share our joy of crafting haptic devices!

more information on this device and its construction in our website:

Please start with reading the website and the research paper found on the website.
