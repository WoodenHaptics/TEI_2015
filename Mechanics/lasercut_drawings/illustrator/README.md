  Please note the following for laser-cutting the parts.

  These files are prepared using the cutlasercut.com template .ai files 
  and then by "place" the .dxf files after scaling (see image
  import-from-dxf-settings.png for how this is done). 

  Note: engraved areas are marked as black through the live paint mode
        which is discouraged by cutlasercut.com, someone with more
        illustrator skills - please help fix them.
