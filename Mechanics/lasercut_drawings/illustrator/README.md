  Please note the following for laser-cutting the parts.

  These files are prepared using the cutlasercut.com template .ai files 
  and then by "place" the .dxf files after scaling (see image
  import-from-dxf-settings.png for how this is done). 

  These updated files are tested for cutting by cutlasercut.com 
  just tell them to use 6.0 mm (or slightly less) plywood and cut
  as straight down as possible.
